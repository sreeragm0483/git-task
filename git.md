# Git

## Basic Terms and Definitions

- **Git**: A distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time.
- **GitHub**: A web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a platform for collaboration and version control.
- **Bitbucket**: A cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control the changes to their code. Bitbucket provides a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Its interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Bitbucket's best-in-class Jira and Trello integrations are designed to bring the entire software team together to execute on a project.

## Git Commands

- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
- `git add`: Adds a file to the staging area.
- `git commit`: Commits changes to the repository.
- `git push`: Pushes commits to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository.

## Industrial Practice

In the industry, Git, GitHub, and Bitbucket are used extensively for version control and collaboration. Developers work on separate branches, then merge their changes into the main branch through a process called a pull request. This allows teams to review code before it's integrated.
